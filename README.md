# Marvel_Encyclopedia_Ver.1
This is a beginning project into creating an online encyclopedia feature characters from Marvel Comics. This initial project will feature background information on some of Marvel Comics' famous or sometimes infamous characters.

Similar to other back-end focus repos, the primary focus is one building a collection using MySQL.

## Early Stages

In the early stages of this repo, the main focus was building up the files to create the connections for the database folder. First was building the connection file allowing the repo to access the database on MySQL. 

Afterwards, the focus shifted towards creating a connection file in the db folder, acting as prompt questions allowing users to view the teams and character currently in the database, as well as adding and deleting characters and teams on the database.
